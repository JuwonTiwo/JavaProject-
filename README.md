# Sky Basket (Educational project)

##About the Project 
We created this project to showcase our skills and what we have learnt in the last couple of weeks and this is a good way to share the project so you can play around with it or make changes.
##Setting up the project
###Prerequisites
1. [JDK 1.7 +] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html)
2. [Tomkat](https://tomcat.apache.org/)
3. [Java IDE](http://www.eclipse.org) (Or one of your preference)
4. Terminal or Console

###Setting up Java Development Kit
This step involves downloading an implementation of the Java Software Development Kit (SDK) and setting up the PATH environment variable appropriately.

You can download SDK from Oracle's Java site âˆ’ Java SE Downloads.
Once you download your Java implementation, follow the given instructions to install and configure the setup. Finally set the PATH and JAVA_HOME environment variables to refer to the directory that contains java and javac, typically java_install_dir/bin and java_install_dir respectively.

If you are running Windows and install the SDK in C:\jdk1.5.0_20, you need to add the following line in your C:\autoexec.bat file.
```
set PATH = C:\jdk1.5.0_20\bin;%PATH%
set JAVA_HOME = C:\jdk1.5.0_20
